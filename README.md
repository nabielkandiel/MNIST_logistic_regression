# MNIST_logistic_regression

## Motivation
I have been really interested in Machine Learning for a while now and have decided to start studying it seriously. While working through Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera I will be doing the Octave projects in Python since that seems to be the language of the industry today.

## What Does It Do
This Python script takes the training MNIST data set from Kaggle and performs Mulit-Class Logistic Regression on it. It then takes the testing data set and outputs the predictions in a CSV format to be uploaded to Kaggle.

## Technologies
* Numpy 
    * for fast mathmatically operations
* Pandas 
    * read in, organize, and output data
* MatPlotLib
    * Create graphs of Cost vs Itterations to monitor gradient descent

## Performance
* Baseline Logistic Regression
    * 89.657% accuracy 
* Logistic Regression with Regularization
   * 89.66% accuracy
